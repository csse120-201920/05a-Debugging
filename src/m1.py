###############################################################################
#
# TODO: 2. READ these instructions, ASKING QUESTIONS as needed.
#
#   This module contains 7 "broken" functions.
#
#   For each broken function, running it will generate what's called
#   an EXCEPTION -- an error that occurs when the program runs and
#   (left to itself) causes the program to end its execution.
#
#   We have written tests for each broken function.
#     *** DO NOT MODIFY THE TESTS. ***
#   In fact, you do not even need to read the tests.
#   Instead, look at the file   m1_pictures.pdf   to see what output
#   the tests should generate.
#
#   To do this exercise, do the following:
#
#   Step 1:
#     -- Read the doc-string (but NOT the code) of the  broken_1  function.
#     -- Look at the  m1_pictures.pdf  file
#          to see what output the tests should produce.
#     -- ASK QUESTIONS AS NEEDED until you understand the specification
#          of the  broken_1  function.
#
#  Step 2:  Run this module.
#     You will see that the code "breaks" and prints on the Console:
#       -- a STACK TRACEBACK of the code that led to the exception
#       -- an error message that attempts to explain the exception
#     Right-click in the Console and select "Word Wrap" to make
#     the stack traceback and error message more readable.
#
#   Step 3:  READ the error message.  Try to make sense of it.
#     ASK QUESTIONS AS NEEDED!
#
#   Step 4:  Click on the BOTTOM blue link in the Console.
#     It will take you to the line at which the code broke.
#       (BUT if the line refers to a line in rosegraphics.py,
#          work your way UP the blue links until you reach
#          the lowermost one that refers to a line in THIS module.)
#
#   Step 5:  Looking at the line at which the code broke,
#     figure out what the error message is telling you.
#     ASK QUESTIONS AS NEEDED!
#
#   Step 6:  Thinking about the green specification of the  broken_1
#     function, and thinking about what the error message tells you,
#     correct the mistake(s).
#
#     Sometimes the mistake will be on the line at which the code broke,
#     sometimes at a line that executed before that line executed.
#
#     After correcting the mistake(s), run the program again.
#     Continue until you believe that the  broken_1  function produces
#     the correct output (per the  m1_pictures.pdf  file)
#     AND you believe that the code for the function is correct.
#
#     ** IMPORTANT: **
#       Resist the urge to "fiddle" with the code until you stumble
#       upon something that works.  This exercise will be helpful
#       to you ONLY if you use it as an opportunity to learn
#       what the error messages mean and how to react to them.
#
#   *** ASK QUESTIONS AS NEEDED! ***
#
#   Once you have corrected the  broken_1  function, continue to
#   the next function, again proceeding according to the above steps.
#
#   When you believe you understand these instructions,
#   change the above TO DO to DONE.
